Hey there,

I am excited to bring my design systems and AI experience to help Google ship cohesive enterprise grade experiences faster.

I build the bridge between design and engineering, turning complex workflows into patterns teams can reuse with confidence.

At Dell I helped lead the Infrastructure Design System, covering foundations, tokens, components, accessibility, and the governance that keeps it healthy across products.

To make the system truly usable I used Figma Code Connect to annotate designs with live code references, props, and usage notes, so product teams could ingest our components directly into their own agentic AI workflows with minimal handoff.

I like to prove ideas in code, including an on prem retrieval augmented assistant and a research library that sped up discovery for hundreds of internal users.

Earlier I cofounded the Dell developer portal and led usability work that shaped its information architecture and launch.

In enterprise systems management I simplified admin flows and dashboards and saw measurable drops in task time across multiple product lines.

I teach design prototyping at the University of Texas and I mentor cross functional teams on systems thinking and rapid exploration.

Warmly,
Eric T Graham`;
